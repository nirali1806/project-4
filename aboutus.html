						<h2>Our Story:</h2>
						<p>The Indian Delicasie Restaurant is conveniently located in the heart of the Vancouver at Downtown with a secluded enough location 
		to enjoy a meal away from the noise of the cityâ€™s hustle bustle.
		Me and my partner started this restaurant in 2015. Initially, we started our journey with catering orders for certain occassions. And as we get more  promoted in our business and seen the desire of Indian food in the city , we decided to make the plan workout for the Indian cuisine restaurant.
		It was just like a nightmare for us. Ofcourse, initial stage is all struggle for everyone, but though we made it to work out. It took over 2 years for us to be stable  grounds and since then it was a steady growth.
		We offer a contemporary interpretation of classic Indian and multi-cuisine dishes in a modern exclusive setting with impeccable service. 
		We have been rated as one of the top restaurants of the city and have been featured as a unique dining experience. 
		Be it a lunch or dinner for two or a large gathering for celebrations and events.The Indian Delicasie is certain to please.</p>
						
					<P>Replete with courtyards and overflowing with beautiful scenary. The Indian Delicasie s comfortably conditioned in all enclosed spaces with free Wi-Fi.  
					Indeed, a home away from home, The Indian Delicasie has been tastefully restored with all its furniture, and fixtures designed and sourced from local artisans.</p>

 This beautiful restaurant is spread over two huge terraces are inter-connected by a smaller one that houses a small wooden cottage. 
 At Agashiye, the food is freshly prepared, a lot of it in the terrace kitchen where you can see it.
 Our attempt is to retain the distinct flavours of the ingredients and we use both spices and oil sparingly.
 The menu at Agashiye changes daily and varies seasonally too, so an item that you particularly liked during a previous visit may not be there on the menu. 
 Though we hope you'd find another favourite!The staff at Agashiye comprises mostly of men from neighboring villages.
 During dinner, they will guide you to the waiting area where you will be served juice and starters. You will be informed when your table is ready.
 During lunch, you are seated at your table right away.The food is served in a kansa thali immediately on being seated at the table. 
 The meal starts with a choice of Indian breads and ends with rice. Servings are unlimited.
 The staff has been instructed not to constantly hover around you and yet be attentive.
 In case you have a specific requirement, a supervisor will be there to assist you.</p>
